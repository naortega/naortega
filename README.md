# About Me

Hello! I'm Nicol√°s Ortega (@naortega). I like working with systems languages like C, C++, Assembly, and lately a bit of Rust. In my free time I also do a bit of language learning.

Although I have a GitHub, my main repositories can be found (currently) on [my GitLab](https://gitlab.com/naortega/), though I hope to switch to self-hosting at some point soon. You can find out more about me on my website: [The Music in Noise](https://themusicinnoise.net/). You can also find my contact information there on the [contact page](https://themusicinnoise.net/contact.html).
